The Drift Collective is a sustainable clothing and handmade bikini company very close to my heart. (Check them out [here](https://www.thedriftcollective.com/)!) In addition to being a kick-ass company, their founder, owner and CEO is none other than my sister, Emily Stearns. So of course I was thrilled at the oportunity to team up with Drift and offer up my skills as a data scientist. to optimize their use of Instagram. I produced a model that predicts the number of likes a post will get with a RMSE of 46 likes, and ran hypothesis tests to determine whether certain post qualities are more successful than others. Some machine learning and statistic tools used are gradient boosted regression modeling, K-Means clustering, natural language processing and frequentist hypothesis testing

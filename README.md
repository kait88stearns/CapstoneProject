# CapstoneProject

For this project I teamed with The Drift Collective, a sustainable clothing and handmade bikini company, to optimize their use of Instagram. I produced a model that predicts the number of likes a post will get with a RMSE of 46 likes, and ran hypothesis tests to determine whether certain post qualities are more successful than others. Some machine learning and statistic tools used are gradient boosted regression modeling, K-Means clustering, natural language processing and frequentist hypothesis testing

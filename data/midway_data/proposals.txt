# Drift Product Recommender:


## Potential business problems:
1. Drift has a lot of product, but limited space in the store front.
2. Since merchandise is all 'one of a kind', difficult to sell online since
  when an item goes, it is gone.
3. Small scale manufacturing team. Would be beneficial to know what sells well
(ie. what to make more of)


## Data
For each order:
1. customer name
2. data/time of order
3. number of items bought
4. cost of items (and total)
5. address (if online purchase)
6. item description (SOMEIMES)
7. Note (RARLY)



A recommender
system might be used by customers to sort inventory that
may not be completely on display ()

User clicks on items they like out x items presented to them. We take that and
recommend items based on their estimated preferences.

## Social Media effect on Store Traffic?
Business Question:
What kinds of posts drive traffic to Drifts online store?
Do certain tags push more traffic?
Is 'effective content' different on Facebook VS Instagram?

### Data:
1. Online Traffic by day by Referrer (ie Facebook, Insta, Direct, Google) (starting in Dec 2015)
2. Instagram Posts (392 so far)
> 1. Date of post
> 2. Day of week
> 2. Tags in post
> 3. Content
>> 1. Product shown
>> 2. one person vs group
>> 3. product shot vs. lifestyle

I am so excited to apply for a Data Scientist position within Glowforge. I spent the past two years assisting in the development and growth of [my sister's/ a] sustainable clothing start-up, The Drift Collective, from its establishment as a one-woman run online operation to the opening of its brick and mortar store location.

Looking into your product and company as a whole, I am impressed by the dedication to quality and customer satisfaction apparent not only by the nearly twenty-eight million dollars sold in your first month, but also though the consistency of the Glowforgeâ€™s rave reviews. The respect a company has for it's customerbase is an apt indicator of 
(I want to say something about how I value a company that respects its customerbase and  cares about the quality of work it produces. 
I want to say that I want to work for a company with these qualities.

and the responsibility it takes for the quality of it's product as two key indicators of  as not only 


	While I am young with limited experience in the workforce, I am confident I have the skills and drive to become a valuable member of the Glowforge Team. I am comfortable working on large sets of data, and proficient with a wide arsonal of regression, machine learning, and python tools.

I am a fast learner and easily adaptable to the new challenges that arise when working in a rapidly changing environment. Additionally, I have 


experience working with very large sets of data in a variety of contexts, including recommender systems, linear regression and  time series.  linear and logistic regression   [.... add something else]  and 


Studying both Studio Art and Math in college gave me a solid footing in both the creative and analytic worlds, something useful in (understanding / finding) the full potential a product like tas verssatile as the Glowforge.
